Markdown is simple and great to work with. It creates excellent standalone documents by allowing us to focus on content and design separately. What I have created here is a very simple way of creating a nested series of pages. You simply create an arbitrary nested series of markdown pages (which may be hosted on github etc) and access them like you would HTML pages. 

Here is an example

```
.
├── hi.md
├── _index.md
└── sub-folder
    ├── _index.md
    └── inner-hi.md
```

this tree can be accessed by simply running the server then going to localhost
